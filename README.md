# grass-endophyte-community-anaysis

This is a repository in which we (myself and colaborators) have access to data pipelines and data.

'alt_biom.ipynb' is a notebook in which I worked from our raw reads into a biom table
'mock_community_2019.ipynb' is a notebook where I followed the lead of Dan Thomas to discern the amount of tag switching that occured in the process of our illumina run

'grass_97_wmeta.biom' is a biom object which was the end result of the 'alt_biom.ipynb' notebook

'grass_biom_20191208.R' is an R script which picks up from the alt biom pipeline and contains all statistical anayses for the manuscript except for the funguild richness analyses.
